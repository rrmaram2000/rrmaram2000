Developing learnable wavelet methods for medical imaging under Prof. Murray Loew

### Research

My research focuses on **learnable wavelets** — adaptive signal decomposition methods where filter coefficients are optimized during training rather than fixed analytically. This approach bridges classical wavelet theory with modern deep learning, enabling data-driven feature extraction for medical imaging tasks.

I maintain the first open-source MATLAB implementation of learnable wavelet layers, with applications in image compression, CT reconstruction, and radiomics feature extraction.
